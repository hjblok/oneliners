# Script to export all certificates in OS X SystemRoots Keychain to OpenSSL
# readible certificates.
#   OS X ships with a full OpenSSL installation and it ships with public 
#   certificates from recognized CAs. The problem is that Unix applications 
#   compiled against the OpenSSL libraries cannot make use of those 
#   certificates. Youâ€™ll need to export them from the system keychain in order 
#   to make them available to those applications.
#   (quoted from http://www.madboa.com/geek/pine-macosx/#openssl)
#
# Reads certificates from /System/Library/Keychains/SystemRootCertificates.keychain
# and exports those certificates in pem format to /System/Library/OpenSSL/certs/
# Also runs c_rehash on the folder /System/Library/OpenSSL/certs/ to add 
# symbolic links to the hash values of the exported pem files.
#
# Usage:
#   sudo ruby pem_export_keychain_certificates_to_openssl.rb
#


# Run's a command and returns an hash with stdout and stderr
# return lines{:stdout => "...", :stderr => "..."}
